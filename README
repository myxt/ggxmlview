XML View extension for eZ publish
===================================

This extension enables a simple, universal publication of content as xml or json,
such as can be consumed eg. by XmlHttpRequests requests or flash clients.
It uses a very basic mapping of class attributes to xml elements, but since it
is 100% template based, it can be overridden to provide any custom mapping
